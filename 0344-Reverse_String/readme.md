Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with `O(1)` extra memory.

Example 1:

> <span style="color: white;">Input</span>: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]<br>
> <span style="color: white;">Output</span>: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:

> <span style="color: white;">Input</span>: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]<br>
> <span style="color: white;">Output</span>: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- `s[i]` is a [printable ascii character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).
